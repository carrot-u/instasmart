DEVELOPMENT AND DEBUGGING

Starting a project

How do we approach a new assignment?

Ask questions
Discuss the design with someone
Google search/code base search
Break it down into tasks
Ask questions

Understand the goal
-get the problem they're trying to solve
-ask questions to go beyond what they're asking for

People rarely ask for what they really want
Understand the limits
Failure cases
Remember, cheaper to discover issues now, this is not a waste of time!
Discuss the design with someone

Talk to your Co-workers to further understanding
-Tech lead
-Manager
-"Rubber duck"
-Google search/code base search (is this cheating?)
  -study and dissect to figure out if will help solve your problem
  -copy good; copy blind bad

  No, this isn't cheating
  You can learn from others
  Make sure you understand what you're looking at
  Potentially copy not so good code

  Break it down into tasks
  -verify each step before moving on
  -Biggest mistake is to builf

Create program spec without particulars first

Try it in the console

Build empty methods based on the program spec

2 kinds of functions
side effects: alters the state of the program
fcns with return values you can do something with

In Ruby, the arugment will transform when run through the function

[[" "] * SIZE] * SIZE will yield 10 identical arrays and any changes will apply to all

objects = abstract data types
  = a representation of something that has functionality
  ex. 1.to_s => "1"

In ruby everything is an object

objects are a great way to break down your tasks
